As a result, we are not realizing the full business benefits of the platform and experience frequent down time and poor system performance. This is the first project and will Stabilize and synchronize non-production environments by copying the Production environment back to DEV and Staging, convert interfaces from LAPI API to new SOAP API required by CS16, Redesign 13 workflows for optimal performance on the current version of PMED, build new environment with CS16 to allow for better performance.</p>

                                    <p>Artemis 7 is a web-based investment portfolio management system that supports organizations that wish to implement a top-down management process to optimize the selection and execution of investments. Using various modules, Artemis 7 provides top-to-bottom support, from the strategic analysis and approval of investment expenditure to the work content definition necessary to successfully execute those investment decisions. Implemented across an enterprise, the modules supporting work content definition can be configured to support each business unit's level of project and resource management maturity.  This approach ensures that corporate governance is maintained without the need to implement a consistent project management process across the enterprise.  The top-down nature of Artemis 7 helps organizations minimize the effort expended on projects that are not aligned to company goals and priorities.</p>
