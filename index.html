Using various modules, Artemis 7 provides top-to-bottom support, from the strategic analysis and approval of investment expenditure to the work content definition necessary to successfully execute those investment decisions. Implemented across an enterprise, the modules supporting work content definition can be configured to support each business unit's level of project and resource management maturity.  This approach ensures that corporate governance is maintained without the need to implement a consistent project management process across the enterprise.  The top-down nature of Artemis 7 helps organizations minimize the effort expended on projects that are not aligned to company goals and priorities.</p>
